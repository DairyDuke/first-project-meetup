# Groupup
Groupup is a clone of the popular social pairing site: Meetup. The main focus of this project is to demonstrate understanding of develop using React, Redux, Sequelize, Express, PostgreSQL, CSS, and various other skills. Everything has been stitched together by a single individual across many sleepless nights. You can find the current working version here:

### Testing/Using it yourself locally.

After cloning/downloading the repository be sure to run NPM INSTALL to grab all of the dependencies you will need. After that is completed you will need to enter the command NPM RUN BUILD --PREFIX FRONTEND. I recommend opening multiple terminals to have the backend and frontend running to view any issues/notices that may come up while in use.
